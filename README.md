# Flipping-Coins-Coding-Challenge
## Time Limit: One and a Half Hours 

# Prompt
We are going to play a simple game. We start with 0 points.  We will flip a coin. If it comes up heads, we get a point.  If comes up tails, we double our current score.

# Questions
1. Let's start with a fair coin. What is our expected score after 5 flips?
2. Suppose we played the game many times, with five flips each. What is the expected standard deviation of the scores?
3. What is our expected score after 15 flips?
4. What is the standard deviation?
5. After 10 flips, what is the probability our score is a power of two? Express this probability as a number between 0 and 1
6. We will start a new game, now with an unfair coin. It has a 2/3 probability of heads, and a 1/3probability of tails. What is our expected score after 10 flips?
7. What is the standard deviation?
8. If we can choose how unfair our coin is, what probability of heads gives us the highest expected score for 10 flips? Express this probability as a number between 0 and 1
